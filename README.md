# Time Series Source Separation with Slow Flows

The current repository offers an implementation of the paper [Time Series Source Separation with Slow Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10182.pdf) presented as a contribution at the second ICML Workshop on Invertible Neural Networks, Normalizing Flows, and Explicit Likelihood Models (2020). 

### Abstract

In this paper, we show that slow feature analysis (SFA), a common time series decomposition method, naturally fits into the flow-based models (FBM) framework, a type of invertible neural latent variable models. Building upon recent advances on blind source separation, we show that such a fit makes the time series decomposition
identifiable.
